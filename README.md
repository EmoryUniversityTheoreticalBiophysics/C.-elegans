C.-elegans
==========

Analyzing and modeling C. elegans sensorimotor dynamics. This repository contains a model that infer stimulus laser power from the centroid velocity of the worm. The details of the model are described in the following paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04685. 

\Model:
Contains the functions that infer the model parameters from the dataset and predict stimulus laser from centroid velocity.

\Statistics:
Contains the functions that use to calculate the statistics presented in the paper.

\Example:
Contains example programs.

\Data:
Contains the dataset used in the paper.
