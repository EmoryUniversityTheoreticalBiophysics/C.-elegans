function []=combine_data(path_to_file, picfname,alldatafname,centroidfname)

The function load centroid, skeleton, curvature, laser power, 
laser position, crawling side and filename data from experiment results 
and combine them into one file. 

Input:
 path_to_file -- path to the folder which contain experiment data
 alldatafname -- name of the folder which contain *_analysis data 
 centroidfname -- name of the folder which contain *_centroid data
 picfname -- name of the folder which contain pictures from the
 experiment

Output:
 no output variables

Output File:
 data will be stored in a file named 'picfname'_data.mat in 
	the directory specified by 'path_to_file'

Output file structure:
xpos -- x position of laser of trial i
ypos -- y position of laser of trial i
data{
 wormskelx -- x position of worm skeleton in <time * position>. Head is
 represented by position 1 and tail is represented by position 41.
 wormskely -- y position of worms keleton in <time * position>. 
 skelcurv2 -- curvature of worm skeleton in <time * position>. Head is
 represented by position 1 and tail is represented by position 37.
 numberofframes -- total number of frames in the video.
 centroid.wormcentroid.c2.Centroid -- Centroid position of the worm
}
I -- laser power of worm i
side -- side of the worm crawl on
 R: the worm was crawling on the right side
 L: the worm was crawling on the left side
 N: crawling side not recorded
