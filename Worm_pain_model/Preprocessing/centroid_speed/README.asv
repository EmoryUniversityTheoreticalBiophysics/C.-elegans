Calculate the centroid speed and save them to speed_*.mat

==========================================================
centroid_speed(path_to_file, datafname, framerate,filterlength)

This function calaculates the worm centroid speed from 
centroid position data. The centroid speed of time t is calculated by calculating
the difference between time t+1 and time t, then multiply it by
framerate. Finally the speed is smoothed by a moving gaussian filter.

Input:
 path_to_file -- path to the file with the centroid 
	position data
 datafname -- filename of the centroid position data file,
	extension '.mat' is assumed
 framerate -- framerate of the data
 filterlength -- size of the window of the gaussian filter

Input file structure:
  data{k} -- cell array of trial k containing:
      centroid (i,j) -- Centroid position of the worm. i represents time and j represents x (j = 1) and y (j = 2) coordinates. 
  I(i) -- laser power of worm i

Output:
 no output variables

Output File:
 data will be stored in a file named 'datafname'_CVel.mat in 
	the directory specified by 'path_to_file'

Output file structure:
  fspeed (i,j) -- filtered centroid velocity at time i of trial j.
  nfspeed (i,j) -- filtered and normalized centroid veloctiy at time i of trial j.
  I(i) -- laser power of worm i.


Dependency:
filter_function.m

===========================================================
filter_function(speed,windowSize)

function [ speed_f2 ] = filter_function(speed,windowSize)

This function apply a moving gaussian filter on the speed vs time data.

Input:
  speed(i) -- centroid velocity at time i.
  windowSize -- size of the window
Output:
  speed_f2(i) -- filtered centroid velocity at time i.
