Maxspeed          

This function calaculates the maximum backward velocity and the time 
which the maximum velocity is reached between starttime and endtime and save the
result in .mat format. This function also seperate the data into binlength groups
according to their laser power and calculate the average and standard
deviation of maximum backward velocity respectively.
