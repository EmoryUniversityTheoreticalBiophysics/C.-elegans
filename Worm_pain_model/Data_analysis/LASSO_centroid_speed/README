# This function utilize LASSO algorithm to find the best linear prediction model of laser power from centroid speed data.
# This function requires glmnet and R.matlab package.
# 
# Input:
#   folderpath -- path to the folder which contain centroid speed data.
#   datafname -- filename of the .mat file which contains centroid speed data.
# 
# Return:
#   Maximum cross validated R square.
# 
# Output File:
#   LASSO results generated by different lambdas will be stored in a file named 'LASSO_result.mat' in the same folder as specified in folderpath.
# 
# Output file structure:
#   nzero(i) -- number of non-zeros coefficients of index i. 
#   r2cv(i) -- Cross-validated R square of index i.
#   LASSOresult(j,i) -- The coefficients of the linear model of index i.
# 
# Output Figures:
#   1. Cross validated R square vs number of non-zeros
#   2. Coefficients of the model at maximum R square
