function []=combine_data(path_to_file, picfname,alldatafname,centroidfname)

The function load centroid, skeleton, curvature, laser power, 
laser position, crawling side and filename data from experiment results 
and combine them into one file. 

Input:
 path_to_file -- path to the folder which contain experiment data
 alldatafname -- name of the folder which contain *_analysis data 
 centroidfname -- name of the folder which contain *_centroid data
 picfname -- name of the folder which contain pictures from the
 experiment

Output:
 no output variables

Output File:
 data will be stored in a file named 'picfname'_data.mat in 
	the directory specified by 'path_to_file'

Output file structure:
xpos -- x position of laser of trial i
ypos -- y position of laser of trial i
data(k) -- cell array of trial k containing:
 wormskelx (i,j) -- x position of worm skeleton in i represents time and j represents relative position on the skeleton. Head is
 represented by position 1 and tail is represented by position 41.
 wormskely (i,j) -- y position of worms keleton. i represents time and j represents relative position on the skeleton. 
 skelcurv2 (i,j) -- curvature of worm skeleton. i represents time and j represents relative position on the skeleton. 
 numberofframes -- total number of frames in the video.
 centroid (i,j) -- Centroid position of the worm. i represents time and j represents x (j = 1) and y (j = 2) coordinates. 
I -- laser power of worm i
side -- side of the worm crawl on
 R: the worm was crawling on the right side
 L: the worm was crawling on the left side
 N: crawling side not recorded
