Scripts and functions that used to process raw data into dataset in \Data

\nonlinear_mapping:

Apply nonlinear transform to laser power by fitting a exponential curve to the maximum centroid speed verse laser power data. 

\combine_rawdata:

load centroid, skeleton, curvature, laser power, laser position, crawling side and filename data from experiment results and combine them into one file. 

\centroid_speed:

Calaculates the worm centroid speed in pixels/s from centroid position data and smooth by a moving gaussian filter.
